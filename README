This project was created to simplify my data entry into a google sheet I use to track my option information

This is a template of the sheet I use if you find it useful to use.

I created that document as a modification of this sheet that I had found and wanted to use.

Currently as of 5/23/2020 only Modifierv3.py has proper functionality.
The form in which to update the sheet is copying the columns directly into the sheet

in later updates there are various features I will be attempting to implement including but not limited to:
- automating data insertion into google sheets
- parsing data directly from robinhood pdfs as apposed to copying the data to a csv first
- Improving data manipulation to allow for contracts to stack
- Data extraction directly from the brokerage
